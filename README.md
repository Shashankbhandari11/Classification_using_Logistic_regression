## Overview  
This project predicts the survival rate in road accidents using **Logistic Regression**. It involves feature selection, data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The goal is to analyze accident data and determine the factors affecting survival chances.

##  Features  
- Feature selection using correlation analysis  
- Data preprocessing (scaling, handling missing values)  
- Logistic Regression model training  
- Performance evaluation using accuracy, classification report, and ROC-AUC score  
- Data visualization using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**  

##  Tech Stack & Dependencies  
This project is built using **Python** and requires the following libraries:  
```bash
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Installation & Usage
Follow these steps to run the project:

Clone the repository:
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Shashankbhandari11/accident-survival-prediction.git

```bash
# Navigate into the project directory
cd accident-survival-prediction

```

## Model Performance
The performance of the Logistic Regression model is evaluated using:

- Accuracy Score
- ROC-AUC Score
- Confusion Matrix & Classification Report
- Data Visualization: Feature correlation heatmaps, performance curves
