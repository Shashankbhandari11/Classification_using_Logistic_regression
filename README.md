## 📌 Overview  
This project predicts the survival rate in road accidents using **Logistic Regression**. It involves feature selection, data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The goal is to analyze accident data and determine the factors affecting survival chances.

## 📊 Features  
- ✅ Feature selection using correlation analysis  
- ✅ Data preprocessing (scaling, handling missing values)  
- ✅ Logistic Regression model training  
- ✅ Performance evaluation using accuracy, classification report, and ROC-AUC score  
- ✅ Data visualization using **Seaborn** and **Matplotlib**  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Dependencies  
This project is built using **Python** and requires the following libraries:  
```bash
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
